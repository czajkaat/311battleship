# To play:
# Run the controller.java with a command line argument, 1 for text display or 2 for GUI display.
# The program will not run if a command line argument is not provided.
#
# To follow the MVC style we have three different classes named for their role, view.java, controller.java, and model.java
# We have also included JUnit tests for the model class. It tests every method in the model class with 100% coverage.
